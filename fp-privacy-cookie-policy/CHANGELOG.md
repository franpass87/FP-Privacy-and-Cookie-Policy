## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Documented the bundled Google Consent Mode v2 defaults and update workflow across the public docs.
- Auto-population of the "URL link policy" field with the Privacy Policy page URL generated by the plugin, eliminating the need for manual entry.

### Changed
- Promoted the floating reopen control and refreshed accessibility references in user-facing guides.
- Expanded the described Privacy & Cookie Policy sections to match the October 2025 GDPR guidance implemented in templates.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-01
### Changed
- Prioritized shortcode containers when bootstrapping the consent banner, wired external preference triggers, and reinforced modal accessibility while seeding saved states through the Consent Mode helper.
- Reused cached detector output for document generation, grouped manual services with localized labels, and expanded embed detection to work across admin, CLI, and configurable cache TTL scenarios.

### Fixed
- Hardened consent persistence by filtering unknown categories, enforcing locked toggles, surfacing REST failures, and exposing a cookie attribute filter along with a site-specific IP hash salt and uninstall cleanup routine.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-28
### Added
- Initial public release featuring the GDPR consent banner, granular categories, consent registry with CSV export and retention, palette preview, Google Consent Mode v2 integration, `fp-consent-change` event, service detection with automated policy generation, shortcodes, ES5 Gutenberg blocks, WP-CLI commands, multisite provisioning, REST API, exporter/eraser handlers, and cron-based cleanup.
- Consent Mode bootstrap fallback to `dataLayer` for asynchronous tag managers together with enriched `fp_consent_update` payloads including timestamps and identifiers.
- Admin banner preview with live contrast checks and stale snapshot notices linking to policy tooling.
